# Customer_Retention_Analysis

For this project, I manipulated user retenetion data using Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries to calculate retention rates and user count for a fictitious application. I first added a seniority column to the main DataFrame to represent the number of days since the user's initial start date. I then grouped the data by country, and lastly generated pivot tables and heatmaps to visually display each country's results. Additionally, I connected each country's DataFrame to a SQL database so that a future analysis could be further explored. 

**Analysis**
  - Jupyter Notebook file used to manipulate the data and generate an initial analysis.
  - SQL queries used to explore further questions around the data. 

**Figures**
  - Heatmap images displaying user count and retention rates per country.
  
**Data**
  - User retention data I used from a fictitious application.
 
To conduct this analysis, I initially used the tutorial below. I took my approach a step further by grouping by country to conduct market specific pivot tables and heatmaps, as well as connecting each DataFrame to a SQL database and writing queries to examine additional questions around the data.
